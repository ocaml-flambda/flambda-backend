(** A path into a mixed block element (identifying some subelement) can be
    considered to partition the mixed block element into three parts: to the
    left, at subelement, and to the right.

    This module counts the number of value and flat bytes in each part, for the
    purpose of computing block indices to the subelement. Also see Note
    [Representation of block indices] in [lambda/translcore.ml].

    - Conservatively, whether an index to [here] could be deepened to have an
      illegal gap. *)
