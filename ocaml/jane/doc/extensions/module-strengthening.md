# The `module strengthening` extension

What is the type of module `M` in this tiny program?

```ocaml
module type S = sig type t end

module M : S
```

If you said `S` then you are only partially correct: we also need to keep track
of the fact that all type declarations inside it (just `t` in this example) come
from `M`. So the type that the compiler infers is actually stronger:

```ocaml
sig type t = M.t end
```

We call this type "`S` strengthened with `M`". It can be written out explicitly
as above and this is, in fact, the only way to write it without `-extension
module_strengthening`. The new extension allows this type to be written as `S
with M`.

The main motivation for this work are compiler performance improvements.
