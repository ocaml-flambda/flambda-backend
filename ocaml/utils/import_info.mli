module CU = Compilation_unit

(* CR mshinwell: maybe there should be a phantom type allowing to distinguish
   the .cmx case from the others. Unclear it's worth it.

   xclerc: I also wonder whether it could be useful to have an abstract Array.t
   in this module. Indeed the import infos are now mutable; we could hide the
   mutability behind an abstract type. I reckon we use only a handful of array
   operations on such values, so it should not be too bad. If that happens, it
   should probably be in another PR.

   (We could also wait for immutable arrays.) *)

(* CR mshinwell/xclerc: maybe the reading and writing code should be put in
   here, or somewhere alongside, rather than being duplicated around the
   tree. *)
