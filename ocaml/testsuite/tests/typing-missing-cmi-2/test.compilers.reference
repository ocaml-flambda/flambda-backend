            ^^^^^^^^^^
Error: This expression has type "'a Foo.t"
       but an expression was expected of type "('b : '_representable_layout_1)"
       The layout of 'a Foo.t is any
         because the .cmi file for Foo.t is missing.
       But the layout of 'a Foo.t must be representable
         because it's the type of a variable bound by a `let`.
       No .cmi file found containing Foo.t.
       Hint: Adding "foo" to your dependencies might help.
