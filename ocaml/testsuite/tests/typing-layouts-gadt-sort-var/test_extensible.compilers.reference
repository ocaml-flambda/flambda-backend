Error: This expression has type t_void -> unit
       but an expression was expected of type 'a -> unit
       The layout of t_void is void
         because of the definition of t_void at file "insert_extensible.ml", line 1, characters 0-18.
       But the layout of t_void must be a sublayout of value
         because of layout requirements from an imported definition.
