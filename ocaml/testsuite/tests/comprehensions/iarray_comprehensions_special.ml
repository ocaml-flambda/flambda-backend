(* Tests for special array comprehension behavior that don't have a direct
   analog for lists.  For array comprehensions, we pre-allocate the resulting
   array if it has a statically-knowable size, which we can see by including 0
   in something that would otherwise run for close enough to forever.  However,
   even if one of the sequences being iterated through is empty, these optimized
   comprehensions will still fail if any individual [for]-[to] or [for]-[downto]
   iterator would overflow an [int]. *)

(* Zeros, even though we'd normally expect this to run for ~forever *)
