type t_void : void
File "_none_", line 1:
Error: Non-value detected in [translmod]:
       Please report this error to the Jane Street compilers team.
       The layout of t_void is void, because
         it's part of the v1 safety check, defaulted to layout void.
       But the layout of t_void must be a sublayout of value, because
         it has to be value for the V1 safety check.
