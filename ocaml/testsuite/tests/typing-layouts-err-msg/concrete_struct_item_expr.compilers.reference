type t_any : any

    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Error: This expression has type t_any but an expression was expected of type
         ('a : '_representable_layout_1)
       The layout of t_any is any, because
         of the definition of t_any at line 6, characters 0-16.
       But the layout of t_any must be representable, because
         it's the type of an expression in a structure.
