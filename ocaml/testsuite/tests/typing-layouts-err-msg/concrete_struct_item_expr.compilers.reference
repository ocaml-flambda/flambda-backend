Error: This expression has type t_any but an expression was expected of type
         ('a : '_representable_layout_1)
       The layout of t_any is any, because
         of the annotation on the declaration of the type t_any.
       But the layout of t_any must be a sublayout of '_representable_layout_1, because
         it's used in an expression in a structure.
