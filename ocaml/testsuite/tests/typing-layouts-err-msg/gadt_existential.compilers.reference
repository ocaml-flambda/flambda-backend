Error: This expression has type a but an expression was expected of type
         'a t = ('a : void)
       The layout of a is value
         because it's an unannotated existential type variable.
       But the layout of a must be a sublayout of void
         because of the definition of f at file "gadt_existential.ml", line 10, characters 6-17.
