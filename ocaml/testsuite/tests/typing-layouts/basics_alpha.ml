(* CR layouts v2: Once we have another sort that can make it through lambda
   (float#), add tests showing the way sort variables will be instantiated.

   1) [let f x = x] roughly has type [('a : '_sort) -> ('a : '_sort)].
      Test that you can apply it to a value or to a #float, but once you've
      done that you can't apply it to the other.

   2) If [f] has a type in the mli (and isn't used in the ml) we get the sort
      from there.
