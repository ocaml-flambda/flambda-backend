  type ('a, 'b, 'd) morph

  (* Due to the implementation in [solver.ml], a mode doesn't have sufficient
     information to infer the object it lives in,  whether at compile-time or
     runtime. There is info at compile-time to distinguish between different
     carrier types, but one can imagine multiple objects with the same carrier
     type. Therefore, we can treat modes as object-blind.

     As a result, user of the solver needs to provide the object the modes live
     in, every time it invokes the solver on some modes.

     Roughly, ['a mode] is represented in the solver as constant of ['a], or [f
     v] where [f] is a morphism from ['b] to ['a] and [v] is some variable of
     ['b]. The ['a] needs additional ['a obj] to decide its position in the
     lattice structure (because again, multiple lattices can share the same
     carrier type). One might think the morphism [f] should know its own source
     and target objects. But since its target object is already given by the
     user for each invocation anyway, we decide to exploit this, and say that "a
     morphism is determined by some [('a, 'b, 'd) morph] together with some ['b
     obj]". That helps reduce the information each [morph] needs to store.

     As a result, in the interaction between the solver and the lattices,
     [morph] always comes with its target object. *)

  (* Usual notion of adjunction:
     Given two morphisms [f : A -> B] and [g : B -> A], we require [f a <= b]
      iff [a <= g b].

     Our solver accepts a wider notion of adjunction and only requires the same
     condition on convex sublattices. To be specific, if [f] and [g] form a
      usual adjunction between [A] and [B], and [A] is a convex sublattice of
     [A'], and [B] is a convex sublattice of [B'], we say that [f] and [g]
     form a partial adjunction between [A'] and [B']. We do not require [f] to
     be defined on [A'\A]. Similar for [g].

     Definition of convex sublattice can be found at:
     https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_(order)#Sublattices

     For example: Define [A = B = {0, 1, 2}] with total ordering. Define both
     [f] and [g] to be the identity function. Obviously [f] and [g] form a usual
     adjunction. Now, further define [A'] = [A], and [B'] = [{0, 1, 2, 3}] with
     total ordering. Obviously [A] is a convex sublattice of [A'], and [B] of
     [B']. Then we say [f] and [g] forms a partial adjunction between [A'] and
     [B'].

     The feature allows the user to invoke [f a <= b'], where [a \in A] and [b'
     \in B']. Similarly, they can invoke [a' <= g b], where [a' \in A'] and [b
     \in B].

     Moreover, if [a' \in A'\A], it is still fine to apply [f] to [a'], but the
     result should not be used as a left mode. This is unfortunately not
     enforcable by the ocaml type system, and we have to rely on user's caution.
  *)

  (* Note that [left_adjoint] and [right_adjoint] returns a [morph] weaker than
     what we want, which is "\exists r. allowed * r". But ocaml doesn't like
     existentials, and this weaker version is good enough for us *)
