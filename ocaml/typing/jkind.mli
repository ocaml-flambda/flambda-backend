(* This module is named Jkind, with a 'j', to distinguish jkinds
   as used here from type kinds (which might be abstract or record or variant,
   etc.). This is clearly far from ideal, but the current scheme has these
   positives:

   * It allows us to call jkinds "kinds" to users, connecting that word with
     a word that actually appears in the code.

   * It allows us to use "layout" to refer to the component of a jkind that
     describes the in-memory/in-register layout of a type. Using "layout"
     to refer to the whole jkind seems worse than the already-terrible "jkind".

   * We could imagine renaming the existing "kind" to something else ("shape"?),
     but that would introduce merge conflicts. Perhaps, with broad support from
     OCaml developers, we can make this switch someday.

   * It is very easy to search for and replace when we have a better name.
*)

(* The externality mode. This tracks whether or not an expression is external
   to the type checker; something external to the type checker can be skipped
   during garbage collection.

   This will eventually be incorporated into the mode
   solver, but it is defined here because we do not yet track externalities
   on expressions, just in jkinds. *)
