  (** The upper bound of the new field value upon mutation. *)

(** Returns [true] is the [mutable_flag] is mutable. Should be called if not
    interested in the payload of [Mutable]. *)
val is_mutable : mutability -> bool

(** Type expressions for the core language.

    The [type_desc] variant defines all the possible type expressions one can
    find in OCaml. [type_expr] wraps this with some annotations.

    The [level] field tracks the level of polymorphism associated to a type,
    guiding the generalization algorithm.
    Put shortly, when referring to a type in a given environment, both the type
    and the environment have a level. If the type has an higher level, then it
    can be considered fully polymorphic (type variables will be printed as
    ['a]), otherwise it'll be weakly polymorphic, or non generalized (type
    variables printed as ['_a]).
    See [http://okmij.org/ftp/ML/generalization.html] for more information.

    Note about [type_declaration]: one should not make the confusion between
    [type_expr] and [type_declaration].

    [type_declaration] refers specifically to the [type] construct in OCaml
    language, where you create and name a new type or type alias.

    [type_expr] is used when you refer to existing types, e.g. when annotating
    the expected type of a value.

    Also, as the type system of OCaml is generative, a [type_declaration] can
    have the side-effect of introducing a new type constructor, different from
    all other known types.
    Whereas [type_expr] is a pure construct which allows referring to existing
    types.

    Note on mutability: TBD.

    This expansion will be stored in the [abbrev_memo] of the corresponding

    In practice, [abbrev_memo] behaves like list of expansions with a mutable
    tail.

    the actual type.  This is fragile in presence of labels where
    there is no principal type.
