(** Floating-point arithmetic.

    OCaml's floating-point numbers follow the
    IEEE 754 standard, using single precision (32 bits) numbers.
    Floating-point operations never raise an exception on overflow,
    underflow, division by zero, etc.  Instead, special IEEE numbers
    are returned as appropriate, such as [infinity] for [1.0s /. 0.0s],
    [neg_infinity] for [-1.0s /. 0.0s], and [nan] ('not a number')
    for [0.0s /. 0.0s].  These special numbers then propagate through
    floating-point computations as expected: for instance,
    [1.0s /. infinity] is [0.0s], basic arithmetic operations
    ([+.], [-.], [*.], [/.]) with [nan] as an argument return [nan], ...

val seeded_hash : int -> t -> int
(** A seeded hash function for floats, with the same output value as
    {!Hashtbl.seeded_hash}. This function allows this module to be passed as
    argument to the functor {!Hashtbl.MakeSeeded}. *)

val hash : t -> int
(** An unseeded hash function for floats, with the same output value as
    {!Hashtbl.hash}. This function allows this module to be passed as argument
    to the functor {!Hashtbl.Make}. *)
