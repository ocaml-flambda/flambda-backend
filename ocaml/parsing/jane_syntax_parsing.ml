(** As mentioned in the .mli file, there are some gory details around the
    particular translation scheme we adopt for moving to and from OCaml ASTs
    ([Parsetree.expression], etc.).  The general idea is that we adopt a scheme
    where each novel piece of syntax is represented using one of two embeddings:

    1. As an AST item carrying an attribute. The AST item serves as the "body"
      of the syntax indicated by the attribute.
    2. As a pair of an extension node and an AST item that serves as the "body".
       Here, the "pair" is embedded as a pair-like construct in the relevant AST
       category, e.g. [include sig [%%extension.EXTNAME];; BODY end] for
       signature items.

    In particular, for an extension named [EXTNAME] (i.e., one
    that is enabled by [-extension EXTNAME] on the command line), the attribute
    (if used) must be [[@jane.EXTNAME]], and the extension (if used) must be
    [[%jane.EXTNAME]]. For built-in syntax, we use [_builtin]
    instead of an extension name.

    In the below example, we use attributes an examples, but it applies equally
    to extensions. We also provide utilities for further desugaring similar
    applications where the embeddings have the longer form
    [[@jane.FEATNAME.ID1.ID2.….IDn]] (with the outermost one being the [n = 0]
    case), as these might be used inside the [EXPR]. (For example, within the
    outermost [[@jane.comprehensions]] term for list and array comprehensions,
    we can also use [[@jane.comprehensions.list]],
    [[@jane.comprehensions.array]], [[@jane.comprehensions.for.in]], etc.).

    As mentioned, we represent terms as a "pair" and don't use the extension
    node or attribute payload; this is so that ppxen can see inside these
    extension nodes or attributes. If we put the subexpressions inside the
    payload, then we couldn't write something like [[[%string "Hello, %{x}!"]
    for x in names]], as [ppx_string] wouldn't traverse inside the payload to
    find the [[%string]] extension node.

    Our novel syntactic features are of course allowed to impose extra
    constraints on what legal bodies are; we're also happy for this translation
    to error in various ways on malformed input, since nobody should ever be
    writing these forms directly.  They're just an implementation detail.

    See modules of type AST below to see how different syntactic categories
    are represented. For example, expressions are encoded using an attribute.

    We provide one module per syntactic category (e.g., [Expression]), of module
    type [AST].  They also provide some simple machinery for working with the
    general [@jane.FEATNAME.ID1.ID2.….IDn] wrapped forms.  To construct one, we
    provide [make_jane_syntax]; to destructure one, we provide
    [match_jane_syntax] (which we expose via [make_of_ast]). Users of this
    module still have to write the transformations in both directions for all
    new syntax, lowering it to extension nodes or attributes and then lifting it
    back out. *)

(** How did we choose between using the attribute embedding and the extension
    node embedding for a particular syntactic category?

    Generally, we prefer the attribute embedding: it's more compatible with
    ppxes that aren't aware of Jane Syntax. (E.g., if a type looks like a tuple,
    it truly is a tuple and not an extension node embedding.)

    We can't apply the attribute embedding everywhere because some syntactic
    categories, like structure items, don't carry attributes. For these, we
    use extension nodes.

    However, the attribute embedding is more inconvenient in some ways than
    the extension node embedding. For example, the attribute embedding requires
    callers to strip out Jane Syntax-related attributes from the attribute list
    before processing it. We've tried to make this obvious from the signature
    of, say, [Jane_syntax.Expression.of_ast], but this is somewhat more
    inconvenient than just operating on the [expr_desc]. Nonetheless, because
    of the advantages with ppxlib interoperability, we've opted for the
    attribute embedding where possible.
