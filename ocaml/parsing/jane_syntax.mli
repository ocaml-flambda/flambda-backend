(** Syntax for Jane Street's novel syntactic features.  This module provides
    three things:

    1. First-class ASTs for all syntax introduced by our language extensions,
       plus one for built-in features; these are split out into a different
       module each ([Comprehensions], etc.).

    2. A first-class AST for each OCaml AST, unifying all our novel syntactic
       features in modules named after the syntactic category
       ([Expression.t], etc.).

    3. A way to interpret these values as terms of the coresponding OCaml ASTs,
       and to match on terms of those OCaml ASTs to see if they're terms from
       our novel syntax.

    We keep our novel syntax separate so that we can avoid having to modify the
    existing AST, as this would break compatibility with every existing ppx and
    other such tooling.

    For details on the rationale behind this approach (and for some of the gory
    details), see [Jane_syntax_parsing]. *)

(* Note [Buildable with upstream]
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   We want to make sure that the various [Jane_*] modules, along with
   [Language_extension_kernel] and a small stub for [Language_extension], are
   buildable with the upstream compiler and compiler-libs.  This allows us to
   import these files into compatibility libraries such as
   {{:https://github.com/janestreet/ppxlib_jane}ppxlib_jane}.  We have CI tests
   which ensure that this property is maintained.

   It is possible that at some point we'll really need to depend on new
   functionality we provide elsewhere in the compiler; at that point, we can
   look into providing stub implementations of these modules for use with the
   upstream compiler instead.  For now, though, this is sufficient.

(* General facility, which we export *)

(** The module type of our extended ASTs for our novel syntax, instantiated once
    for each syntactic category.  We tend to call the pattern-matching functions
    here with unusual indentation, not indenting the [None] branch further so as
    to avoid merge conflicts with upstream. *)
module type AST = sig
  (** The AST for all our Jane Street syntax; one constructor per feature that
      extends the given syntactic category.  Some extensions are handled
      separately and thus are not listed here.

      This type will be something like [jane_syntax_ast * Parsetree.attributes]
      in cases where the Jane Syntax encoding of the AST uses attributes. In
      these cases, the [Parsetree.attributes] are the *rest* of the attributes
      after removing Jane Syntax-related attributes. Callers of [of_ast] should
      refer to these attributes rather than, for example, [pexp_attributes].
  *)
  type t

  (** The corresponding OCaml AST *)
  type ast

  (** Given an OCaml AST node, check to see if it corresponds to an embedded
      term from our novel syntax.  If it does, as long as the feature isn't a
      disabled language extension, then return it; if it's not a piece of novel
      syntax, return [None]; if it's an embedded term from a disabled language
      extension, raise an error.

      AN IMPORTANT NOTE: The design of this function is careful to make merge
      conflicts with upstream less likely: we want no edits at all -- not even
      indentation -- to surrounding code. This is why we return a [t option],
      not some structure that could include the [ast_desc] if there is no
      extension.

      Indentation: we *do not change the indentation level* when we match on
      this function's result!  E.g. from [type_expect_] in [typecore.ml]:

      {[
        match Jane_syntax.Expression.of_ast sexp with
        | Some jexp ->
            type_expect_jane_syntax
              ~loc
              ~env
              ~expected_mode
              ~ty_expected
              ~explanation
              ~attributes:sexp.pexp_attributes
              jexp
        | None      -> match sexp.pexp_desc with
        | Pexp_ident lid ->
            let path, mode, desc, kind = type_ident env ~recarg lid in
            (* ... *)
        | Pexp_constant(Pconst_string (str, _, _) as cst) ->
            register_allocation expected_mode;
            (* ... *)
        | (* ... *)
        | Pexp_unreachable ->
            re { exp_desc = Texp_unreachable;
                 exp_loc = loc; exp_extra = [];
                 exp_type = instance ty_expected;
                 exp_mode = expected_mode.mode;
                 exp_attributes = sexp.pexp_attributes;
                 exp_env = env }
      ]}

      Note that we match on the result of this function, forward to
      [type_expect_jane_syntax] if we get something, and otherwise do the real
      match on [sexp.pexp_desc] *without going up an indentation level*.  This
      is important to reduce the number of merge conflicts. *)
