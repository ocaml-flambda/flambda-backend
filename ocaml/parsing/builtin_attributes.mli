(** [register_attr] must be called on the locations of all attributes that
    should be tracked for the purpose of misplaced attribute warnings.  In
    particular, it should be called on all attributes that are present in the
    source program except those that are contained in the payload of another
    attribute (because these may be left behind by a ppx and intentionally
    ignored by the compiler).

    The [attr_tracking_time] argument indicates when the attr is being added for
    tracking - either when it is created in the parser or when we see it while
    running the check in the [Ast_invariants] module.  This ensures that we
    track only attributes from the final version of the parse tree: we skip
    adding attributes at parse time if we can see that a ppx will be run later,
    because the [Ast_invariants] check is always run on the result of a ppx.

    Note that the [Ast_invariants] check is also run on parse trees created from
    marshalled ast files if no ppx is being used, ensuring we don't miss
    attributes in that case.

    "unrolled" only in the case where flambda or flambda2 is configured).  We
    handle this by taking a bool, rather than simply passing fewer nms in those
    cases, to support misplaced attribute warnings - the attribute should not
    count as misplaced if the compiler could use it in some configuration.

(* [jkind] gets the jkind in the attributes if one is present.  We always
   allow the [value] annotation, even if the layouts extensions are disabled.
   If [~legacy_immediate] is true, we allow [immediate] and [immediate64]
   attributes even if the layouts extensions are disabled - this is used to
   support the original immediacy attributes, which are now implemented in terms
   of jkinds.

   The return value is [Error <jkind>] if a jkind attribute is present but
   not allowed by the current set of extensions.  Otherwise it is [Ok None] if
   there is no jkind annotation and [Ok (Some jkind)] if there is one.

   - If no layout extensions are on and [~legacy_immediate] is false, this will
     always return [Ok None], [Ok (Some Value)], or [Error ...].
   - If no layout extensions are on and [~legacy_immediate] is true, this will
     error on [void], [float64], or [any], but allow [immediate], [immediate64],
     and [value].
   - If the [Layouts_beta] extension is on, this behaves like the previous case
     regardless of the value of [~legacy_immediate], except that it allows
     [float64] and [any].
   - If the [Layouts_alpha] extension is on, this can return any jkind and
     never errors.

   Currently, the [Layouts] extension is ignored - it's no different than
   turning on no layout extensions.

   This is not the only place the layouts extension level is checked.  If you're
   changing what's allowed in a given level, you may also need to make changes
   in the parser, Jkind.get_required_layouts_level, and Typeopt.
