(** [register_attr] must be called on the locations of all attributes that
    should be tracked for the purpose of misplaced attribute warnings.  In
    particular, it should be called on all attributes that are present in the
    source program except those that are contained in the payload of another
    attribute (because these may be left behind by a ppx and intentionally
    ignored by the compiler).

    The [attr_tracking_time] argument indicates when the attr is being added for
    tracking - either when it is created in the parser or when we see it while
    running the check in the [Ast_invariants] module.  This ensures that we
    track only attributes from the final version of the parse tree: we skip
    adding attributes at parse time if we can see that a ppx will be run later,
    because the [Ast_invariants] check is always run on the result of a ppx.

    Note that the [Ast_invariants] check is also run on parse trees created from
    marshalled ast files if no ppx is being used, ensuring we don't miss
    attributes in that case.

    attribute names along with a boolean indicating whether to include
    attributes with those names in the output.  The boolean is used to
    accomodate different compiler configurations (e.g., we may want to check for
    "unrolled" only in the case where flambda or flambda2 is configured).  We
    handle this by taking a bool, rather than simply passing fewer nms in those
    cases, to support misplaced attribute warnings - the attribute should not
    count as misplaced if the compiler could use it in some configuration.
