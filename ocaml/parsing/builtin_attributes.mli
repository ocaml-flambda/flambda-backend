(** {2 Attribute tracking for warning 53} *)

(** [register_attr] must be called on the locations of all attributes that
    should be tracked for the purpose of misplaced attribute warnings.  In
    particular, it should be called on all attributes that are present in the
    source program except those that are contained in the payload of another
    attribute (because these may be left behind by a ppx and intentionally
    ignored by the compiler).

    The [current_phase] argument indicates when this function is being called
    - either when an attribute is created in the parser or when we see an
    attribute while running the check in the [Ast_invariants] module.  This is
    used to ensure that we track only attributes from the final version of the
    parse tree: we skip adding attributes seen at parse time if we can see that
    a ppx will be run later, because the [Ast_invariants] check is always run on
    the result of a ppx.

    Note that the [Ast_invariants] check is also run on parse trees created from
    marshalled ast files if no ppx is being used, ensuring we don't miss
    attributes in that case.

    Some attributes, like deprecation markers, do not affect the compilation of
    the definition on which they appear, but rather result in warnings on future
    uses of that definition.  This is implemented by moving the raw attributes
    into the environment, where they will be noticed on future accesses.

    To make misplaced attribute warnings work appropriately for these
    attributes, we mark them "used" when they are moved into the environment.
    This is done with the helper functions in this section.
