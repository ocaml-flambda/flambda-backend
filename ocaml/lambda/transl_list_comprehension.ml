(** List comprehensions are compiled in terms of "reversed difference lists".  A
    difference list in general is a function from lists to lists; by "reversed",
    we mean that these lists are stored backwards, and need to be reversed at
    the end.  We make both these choices for the usual efficiency reasons;
    difference lists allow for efficient concatenation; they can also be viewed
    as based on passing around accumulators, which allows us to make our
    functions tail-recursive, at the cost of building our lists up backwards.
    An additional choice we make is to build all these intermediate data
    structures on the stack (i.e., make them [local_]); again, this is for
    efficiency, as it means we don't need to get the structure of these
    difference lists involved with the garbage collector.  Since we can
    currently only generate global lists with list comprehensions (see the
    comment "What modes should comprehensions use?" in [typecore.ml]), we need a
    type that is spine-local but element-global; we thus define a custom type of
    such snoc lists, and define our difference lists in terms of that, in the
    internal module [CamlinternalComprehension]:
    {[
      type 'a rev_list =
        | Nil
        | Snoc of { init : 'a rev_list; global_ last : 'a }

      type 'a rev_dlist = local_ 'a rev_list -> local_ 'a rev_list
    ]}
    We then work exclusively in terms of [local_ 'a rev_dlist] values, reversing
    them into a global [list] only at the very end.

    We desugar each iterator of a list comprehension into the application of a
    tail-recursive higher-order function analogous to `concat_map`, whose type
    is of the following form:
    {[
      ...iterator arguments... ->
      local_ ('elt -> local_ 'res rev_dlist) ->
      local_ 'res rev_dlist
    ]}
    Here, the [...iterator arguments...] define the sequence of values to be
    iterated over (the [seq] of a [for pat in seq] iterator, or the [start] and
    [end] of a [for x = start to/downto end] iterator); the function argument is
    then to be called once for each item.  What goes in the function?  It will
    be the next iterator, desugared in the same way.  At any time, a [when]
    clause might intervene, which is simply desugared into a conditional that
    gates entering the next phase of the translation.

    Eventually, we reach the body, which is placed into the body of the
    innermost translated function; it produces the single-item reversed
    difference list (alternatively, snocs its generated value onto the
    accumulator).  Because each function is analogous to `concat_map`, this
    builds up the correct list in the end.  The whole thing is then passed into
    a reversal function, building the final list.

    For example, consider the following list comprehension:
    {[
      [x+y for x = 1 to 3 when x <> 2 for y in [10*x; 100*x]]
      (* = [11; 101; 33; 303] *)
    ]}
    This translates to the (Lambda equivalent of) the following:
    {[
      (* Convert the result to a normal list *)
      CamlinternalComprehension.rev_list_to_list (
        (* for x = 1 to 3 *)
        let start = 1 in
        let stop  = 3 in
        CamlinternalComprehension.rev_dlist_concat_iterate_up
          start stop
          (fun x acc_x -> local_
            (* when x <> 2 *)
            if x <> 2
            then
              (* for y in [10*x; 100*x] *)
              let iter_list = [10*x; 100*x] in
              CamlinternalComprehension.rev_dlist_concat_map
                iter_list
                (fun y acc_y -> local_
                  (* The body: x+y *)
                  Snoc { init = acc_y; last = x*y })
                acc_x
            else
              acc_x)
          Nil)
         ]}

(** An implementation note: Many of the functions in this file need to translate
    expressions from Typedtree to Lambda; to avoid strange dependency ordering,
    we parameterize those functions by [Translcore.transl_exp], and pass it in

    that it requires. *)

    create them until that exists, hence [lazy]. *)
