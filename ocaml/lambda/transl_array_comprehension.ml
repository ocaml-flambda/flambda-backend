(** Array comprehensions are compiled by turning into a nested series of loops
    that mutably update an array.  This is simple to say, but slightly tricky to
    do.  One complexity is that we want to apply an optimization to certain
    array comprehensions: if an array comprehension contains exactly one clause,
    and itâ€™s a [for ... and ...] clause, then we can allocate an array of
    exactly the right size up front (instead of having to grow the generated
    array dynamically, as we usually do).  We call this the *fixed-size array
    comprehension optimization*.  We cannot do this with nested [for]s, as the
    sizes of iterators further to the right could depend on the values generated
    by those on the left; indeed, this is why we have [for ... and ...] instead
    of just allowing the user to nest [for]s.

    In general, there are three major sources of complexity to be aware of in
    this translation:

    1. We need to have a resizable array, as most array comprehensions have an
       unknown size (but see point (2)); however, OCaml arrays can't grow or
       shrink, so we have to do this ourselves.

    2. We need to perform the fixed-size array comprehension optimization, as
       described above; this requires handling things specially when the
       comprehension has the form [[|BODY for ITER and ITER ... and ITER|]].
       This ends up getting its tentacles throughout the entire module, as we
       want to share a lot of the code but have to parameterize it over these
       two kinds of output.

    3. We have to handle the float array optimization, so we can't simply
       allocate arrays in a uniform way; if we don't know what's in the array,
       we have to carefully handle things on the first iteration.  These details
       are more local in scope, but particularly fiddly.

    In general, the structure is: we allocate an array and a mutable index
    counter that starts at [0]; each iterator becomes a loop; [when] clauses
    become an [if] expression, same as with lists; and in the body, every time
    we generate an array element, we set it and increment the index counter by
    one.  If we're not in the fixed-size array case, then we also need the array
    to be growable, the first source of extra complexity; we keep track of the
    array size, and if we would ever exceed it, we double the size of the array.
    This means that at the end, we have to use a subarray operation to cut it
    down to the right size.

    In the fixed-size array case, the second source of extra complexity, we have
    to first compute the size of every iterator and multiply them together; in
    both cases, we have to check for overflow, in which case we simply fail.  We
    also check to see if any of the iterators would be empty (have size [0]), in
    which case we can shortcut this whole process and simply return an empty
    array.  Once we do that, though, the loop body is simpler as there's no need
    to double the array size, and we don't need to cut the list down to size at
    the end.  This has ramifications throughout the translation code, as we have
    to add a bunch of extra special-case logic to handle this: we have to store
    enough information to be able to compute iterator sizes if we need to; we
    have to be able to switch between having a resizable and a fixed-size array;
    we don't need to introduce the same number of variable bindings in each
    case; etc.  Various bits of the code make these decisions (for these
    examples: the [Iterator_bindings] module and the [initial_array] and [body]
    functions, all in this file).

    Finally, handling the float array optimization also affects the initial
    array and the element assignment (so this ends up being a locus for all the
    sources of complexity).  If the array has an unknown array kind
    ([Pgenarray]), then we can't allocate it with nonzero size without having
    the first element!  Thus, no matter whether we are in the normal case or the
    fixed-size case, we have to set the initial array to be completely empty.
    Then, on the first iteration through the loop, we can finally create the
    real array, by allocating either the initial values for a resizable array or
    precisely enough values for a fixed-size array and setting all of them to
    the newly-computed first element of the resulting array.  The initial array
    creation is done by the function [initial_array], and the index checking is
    done (among other things) by the function [body].

    To see some examples of what this translation looks like, consider the
    following array comprehension:
    {[
      [x+y for x = 1 to 3 when x <> 2 for y in [10*x; 100*x]]
      (* = [11; 101; 33; 303] *)
    ]}
    This translates to the (Lambda equivalent of) the following:
    {[
      (* Allocate the (resizable) array *)
      let array_size = ref 8 in
      let array      = ref [|0; 0; 0; 0; 0; 0; 0; 0|] in
      (* Next element to be generated *)
      let index = ref 0 in
      (* for x = 1 to 3 *)
      let start = 1 in
      let stop  = 3 in
      for x = start to stop do
        (* when x <> 2 *)
        if x <> 2 then
          (* for y in [|10*x; 100*x|] *)
          let iter_arr = [|10*x; 100*x|] in
          for iter_ix = 0 to Array.length iter_arr - 1 do
            let y = iter_arr.(iter_ix) in
            (* Resize the array if necessary *)
            if not (!index < !array_size) then begin
              array_size := 2 * !array_size;
              array      := Array.append !array !array
            end;
            (* The body: x + y *)
            !array.(!index) <- x + y;
            index := !index + 1
          done
      done;
      (* Cut the array back down to size *)
      Array.sub !array 0 !index
    ]}
    On the other hand, consider this array comprehension, which is subject to
    the fixed-size array comprehension optimization:
    {[
      [|x*y for x = 1 to 3 and y = 10 downto 8|]
      (* = [|10; 9; 8; 20; 18; 16; 30; 27; 24|] *)
    ]}
    This translates to the (Lambda equivalent of) the following rather different
    OCaml:
    {[
      (* ... = 1 to 3 *)
      let start_x = 1  in
      let stop_x  = 3  in
      (* ... = 10 downto 8 *)
      let start_y = 10 in
      let stop_y  = 8  in
      (* Check if any iterators are empty *)
      if start_x > stop_x || start_y < stop_y
      then
        (* If so, return the empty array *)
        [||]
      else
        (* Precompute the array size *)
        let array_size =
          (* Compute the size of the range [1 to 3], failing on overflow (the
             case where the range is correctly size 0 is handled by the
             emptiness check) *)
          let x_size =
            let range_size = (stop_x - start_x) + 1 in
            if range_size > 0
            then range_size
            else raise (Invalid_argument "integer overflow when precomputing \
                                          the size of an array comprehension")
          in

          in

             because we checked that above *)
          let product = x_size * y_size in

          then product
          else raise (Invalid_argument "integer overflow when precomputing \
                                        the size of an array comprehension")
        in
        (* Allocate the (nonresizable) array *)
        let array = Array.make array_size 0 in
        (* Next element to be generated *)
        let index = ref 0 in
        (* for x = 1 to 3 *)
        for x = start_x to stop_x do

    checking work to be done. *)

    arguments to this function):

    * The float array optimization means that we may not know the type of
      elements that go into this array, and so need to wait to actually create
      an array until we have seen the first element.  In this case, we have to
      return an empty array that will get overwritten later.

    * The fixed-size optimization means that we may want to preallocate the
      entire array all at once, instead of allocating a resizable array and
      growing it.

    Importantly, the two cases can co-occur, in which case later code needs to
    be aware of what has happened.

    The array that is returned is bound as a [Variable] in both the case where
    we're subject to the float array optimization (i.e., [array_kind] is
    [Pgenarray]) and in the case where nothing special occurs and the array is
    resizable; in the fixed-size array case, the resulting array is bound
    immutably, although it is still internally mutable.  This logic is important
    when translating comprehension bodies; see [body] for details. *)

     the array.

     1. We are subject to the float array optimization: The array kind is
        [Pgenarray].  In this case, we create an immutable empty array as a
        [Variable], since rather than being updated it will simply be
        overwritten once we have the first element.  This is the only time a
        fixed-size array needs to be a [Variable], since it will be overwritten
        on the first iteration.
     2. The array is of fixed size and known array kind, in which case we use
        [make_(float_)vect] to create the array, and bind it as [StrictOpt]
        since it never needs to be overwritten to be resized or replaced.
     3. The array is of unknown size and known array kind, in which case we
        create a small array of default values using [Pmakearray] and bind it as
        a [Variable] so that it can be overwritten when its size needs to be
        doubled. *)

    logic varies depending on whether we are subject to the float array

       2. Assign it (mutably) to the next element of the array
       3. Advance the index of the next element
     However, there are several pieces of complexity:
       (a) If the array size is not fixed, we have to check if the index has
           overflowed; if it has, we have to double the size of the array.  (The
           complex case corresponds to [array_sizing] being [Dynamic_size].)
       (b) If the array kind is not statically known, we initially created an
           empty array; we have to check if we're on the first iteration and use
           the putative first element of the array as the placeholder value for
           every element of the array.  (The complex case corresponds to
           [array_kind] being [Pgenarray].)
       (c) If both (a) and (b) hold, we shouldn't bother checking for an
           overflowed index on the first loop iteration.
     The result is that we build the "set the element" behavior in three steps:
       i.   First, we build the raw "set the element unconditionally" expression
            ([set_element_raw]).
       ii.  Then, if necessary, we precede that with the resizing check;
            otherwise, we leave the raw behavior alone
            ([set_element_in_bounds]).
       iii. Then, if necessary, we check to see if we're on the first iteration
            and create the fresh array instead if so; otherwise, we leave the
            size-safe behavior alone ([set_element_known_kind_in_bounds]).
       iv.  Finally, we take the resulting safe element-setting behavior (which
            could be equal to the result from any of stages i--iii), and follow
            it up by advancing the index of the element to update.
