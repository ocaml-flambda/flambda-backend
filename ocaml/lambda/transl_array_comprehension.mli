(** Translate array comprehensions; see the .ml file for more details *)

(** Translate an array comprehension ([Typedtree.comprehension], when it's the
    body of a [Typedtree.Texp_array_comprehension]) into Lambda.  This generates
    more efficient code in the case where the array has a known fixed size, by
    preallocating the generated array; otherwise, it dynamically resizes the
    generated array, cutting it back down to size at the end.  The [array_kind]
    of the resulting array must be provided.  We do not need to pass in whether
    the resulting array should be mutable or immutable; both sorts of arrays
    will be constructed mutably, and the type checker has already enforced that
    only mutable arrays are actually used mutably.

    The only variables this term refers to are those that come from the array
    comprehension itself; some C primitives are referenced, but no standard
    library functions.

    This function needs to translate expressions from Typedtree into Lambda, and
    so is parameterized by [Translcore.transl_exp], its [scopes] argument, and
    the [loc]ation. *)
