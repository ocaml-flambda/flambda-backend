; Note that we don't guarantee that a 32-bit build can read a capture from a
; 64-bit build. In particular, >32-bit object identifiers get truncated. Thus we
; don't expect bit-for-bit accuracy on 32-bit systems. We still do the textual
; diff above to be sure that readers and writers are consistent.
