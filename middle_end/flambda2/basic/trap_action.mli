(** Actions affecting exception traps on the stack. These are always associated
    with an [Apply_cont] node; the trap action is executed before the
    application of the continuation.

    Beware: continuations cannot be used both as an exception handler and as a
    normal continuation (since continuations used as exception handlers use a
    calling convention that may differ from normal). *)
