(** {2 Delayed let-bindings}

    Let-bindings are delayed in a certain way to allow for potential reordering
    and inlining of the defining expressions of bound variables that are used
    exactly once. This behaviour (which are a more powerful version of the
    [Un_anf] pass from Flambda 1) does not change semantics. However they allow
    the Cmm code to adopt the forms expected by the Cmm optimisation functions
    (in [Cmm_helpers], for example the arithmetic optimisations) and the
    instruction selection pass (for example where matches may be done on
    function applications and their arguments). Without this, many pattern
    matches on the Cmm terms would fail, leading to poor code generation.

    The delaying process works by partitioning let-bindings into two categories
    according to the effects and coeffects of their defining expressions:

    - bindings whose defining expressions are _pure_, that is to say have
    neither effects nor coeffects;

    - bindings that have effects and/or coeffects.

    Bindings in the first category, by virtue of the absence of effects and
    coeffects, will be allowed to commute with any other bindings.

    The second category of bindings is organised into an ordered list of
    _stages_. A stage is a set of bindings that can all commute with each other.
    Bindings inside stages cannot commute across stages; and stages cannot
    commute.

    One stage consists of either:

    - an ordered list of bindings all of which have only coeffects; or

    - a single effectful binding.

    When a binding is considered for addition to the most recent stage, it may
    either be appended to that stage, or else the stage is "archived" and a new
    stage started containing the new binding.

    The defining expression of a binding used exactly once may be inlined only
    if the binding occurs in the current stage or is pure. Inlining of a binding
    causes it to be removed from its stage (empty stages are then removed from
    the head of the list of stages).

    Other bindings are delayed until they are explicitly flushed. Exactly which
    bindings get flushed at different points, for example prior to function
    calls or branching control flow, depends on decisions outside of this module
    (e.g. in [To_cmm_expr]).

    Additionally, bindings that must be inlined must be treated with special
    care. Most notably, most of the time, we are in the case of a binding "let x
    = prim(args)" where the primitive 'prim' is marked as `Delay`, which we
    translate as Must_inline. In such cases, we want to inline the primitive
    itself, but not necessarily its arguments. To correctly handle such cases,
    we have a notion of "complex" bound argument that, in addition to a cmm
    expression, also contains the arguments and a way to re-build the
    expression. *)

    needed. The effects that are passed must correspond respectively to each
    individual argument and to the primitive itself. *)
