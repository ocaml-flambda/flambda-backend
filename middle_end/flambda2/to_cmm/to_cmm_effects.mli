          For the purpose of To_cmm, generative effects, i.e. allocations, are
          considered to have effects. This is because the mutable state of the
          GC that allocations affect can be observed by coeffects performed by
          function calls (in particular those coming from the Gc module). *)
  | Coeffect_only
      (** Coeffects without any effect. These expression can commute with other
          coeffectful expressions (and pure expressions), but cannot commute
          with an effectful expression. *)
  | Generative_immutable
      (** Only immutable generative effects. These are technically effects
          (since functions in the `Gc` module can read counters related to
          allocations), but we are interested in moving allocation (e.g. for
          unboxing of numbers in classic mode). *)
