   in all blocks where they appear.

   We assume an ideal (i.e. compact) layout for a block containing
   a set of closures is the following:

 * |----------------------|
 * | Infix_header         |
 * |----------------------|
 * | fn_block_1           |
 * | (pos x, size 2 or 3) |  (x=3 if fn_block_0 is of size 2 for instance)
 * |----------------------|
 * | Infix_header         |

(*
   However, that ideal layout may not be possible in certain circumstances,
   as there may be arbitrary holes between slots (i.e. unused words in the block).

   Starting from ocaml 4.12, all closure slots must occur before all env var slots,
   since the start of the environment is recorded in the arity field of each function
   slot arity field.

   This additional requirement makes more constraints impossible to satisfy (to be
   clear, there are situations impossible to satisfy regardless of this requirement;
   it's just that this requirement makes some situations that were previously
   possible to satisfy be now unsatisfiable).

   For instance, it is perfectly possible to have a situation where an env_value has
   been fixed at offset 3 (because it is in a simple closure with one function of
   arity > 1 in another cmx), however it is in a closure set with more than one closure
   in the current compilation unit. In this case, it is impossible to make all the closures
   fit before the env_value in the closure block.
