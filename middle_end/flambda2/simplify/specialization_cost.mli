(** {Continuation Specialization Cost}

    Continuation specialization is done in simplify on the way down.
    Consider a term of the form: *)

(** * let_cont k x =
    *   let_cont k' y =
    *     ...
    *   in
    *   ..
    *   switch x with
    *   | 0 -> k' 0
    *   | 1 -> k' 1
    * in
    * ..
    * switch .. with
    * | 0 -> k 0
    * | 1 -> k 1
    *)

(** The decision to specialize continuation k
    is made once Simplify has reached the bottom of the handler of k.
    This allows to know all of the relevant
    information before deciding whether to specialize [k]: all uses of [k] have been
    seen, and we have also seen the code for the handler of [ĸ].

    The type [t] represents an accumulator updated while doing the downwards pass
    on the handler of [k] to record enough information to estimate the cost of a
    specialization of [k], and whether there was any reason to **not** specialize
    [k] regardless of the cost *)
