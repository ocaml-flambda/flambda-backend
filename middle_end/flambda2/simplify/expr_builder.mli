(** Functions for rebuilding expressions that are used during
    simplification.  Unlike the basic creation functions in [Expr] these
    functions do things such as keeping track of free names and
    avoiding generation of unused bindings.  They also elide construction of
    the terms themselves if required, e.g. during speculative inlining.

    Some expressions are rebuilt directly using the functions in [Rebuilt_expr]
    rather than using this module. *)

(** Create [Let] binding(s) around a given body.  (The type of this function
    prevents it from being used to create "let symbol" bindings; use the
    other functions in this module instead.)  Bindings will be elided if they
    are unused.

    2. Closure variables are removed if they are not used according to the
