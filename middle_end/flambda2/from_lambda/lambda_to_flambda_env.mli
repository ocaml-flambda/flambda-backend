(** About local allocation regions:

      In this pass, we have to transform [Lregion] expressions in Lambda to
      primitives that mark the opening and closing of stack regions. We need to
      ensure regions are always closed so as to not leak out of their scope.
      They must also never be closed twice.

      Several nested regions can be closed with one primitive as [End_region id]
      which will close [id] and every other region opened in its scope. As such,
      the transformation doesn't need to generate strict pairings of
      [Begin_region] and [End_region] in every case. We may jump out of the
      scope of several regions at once, in particular with exception raises from
      [Lstaticraise].

      Another case requiring attention is function calls in tail position for
      which we may need to add an [End_region] before the jump.

      This implementation works as follows.

      For normal control flow, following the block structure of Lambda
      expressions, we insert a new continuation (called the "region closure
      continuation") upon encountering [Begin_region]; then at every leaf we
      cause the control flow to jump via that continuation. The region closure
      continuation closes the relevant region before jumping to what would have
      been the "real" continuation of the leaf expressions in question. The
      insertion of the continuation avoids duplication of the [End_region]
      constructs. (We only need one [Begin_region] per region, but potentially
      as many [End_region]s as there are leaves in the subsequent term.)

      For exceptional control flow, the region closure continuation is not used;
      instead, a region is opened before the beginning of a Trywith, so that we
      can use this region to close every subsequent regions opened in its scope
      at the beginning of the handler.

      Likewise, when regions must be closed explicitly prior to tail calls to
      avoid leaking memory on the local allocation stack, the closure
      continuation is also not used in favour of explicit insertion of
      [End_region] operations.

      Region closure continuations are created alongside corresponding
      [Begin_region]s in the [Lregion] cases of [cps_non_tail] and [cps_tail].
      The decision as to calling a closure continuation or adding explicit
      [End_region]s is done in [restore_continuation_context] and
      [wrap_return_continuation]. Exceptional control flow cases are handled by
      the [compile_staticfail] and [Ltrywith] cases of the main transformation
      functions. *)
