(** Cost metrics are a group of metrics tracking the impact of simplifying an

    machine code for this expression. It also tracks the number of operations
    that should have been executed but were removed by the simplifier.*)

(* The metrics for a set of closures are the sum of the metrics for each closure
   it contains. The intuition behind it is that if we do inline a function f in
   which a set of closure is defined then we will copy the body of all functions
   referred by this set of closure as they are dependent upon f. *)
(*
