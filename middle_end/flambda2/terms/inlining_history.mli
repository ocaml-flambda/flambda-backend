(* Track the history of a term through the inliner.
 *   Each apply and function declaration node is associated to an history.
 *   This history possess information about the how the term was created.
 *
 *   For example take the following piece of code:
 *   ```
 *   (* A.ml *)
 *   let foo arg =
 *      let[@inline never] bar arg = .... in
 *      bar x
 *
 *   let baz x = foo ()
 *   ```
 *   - the function [foo] is associated to the history [A.foo]
 *   - the function [bar] is associated to the history [A.foo.bar]
 *   - the call to [bar] is associated to the history [A.foo calls A.foo.bar]
 *   - the call to [foo] is associated to the history [A.baz calls A.foo]
 *
 *   Now if [foo] gets inline the code becomes:
 *   ```
 *   (* A.ml *)
 *   let baz x =
 *      let[@inline never] bar arg = .... in
 *      bar x
 *   ```
 *   - the function [baz] is associated to the history [A.baz]
 *   - the function [bar] is associated to the history [A.bar coming from inlining A.bar]
 *   - the call to [bar] is associated to the history [A.baz calls (A.bar which was coming from inlining A.bar)]
 *
 *   This modules exports three submodules:
 *   - [Absolute] which is an inlining history rooted to the toplevel a
 *     compilation unit.
 *   - [Relative] which is a chunk of an inlining history. It describes what
 *     happened since the last recorded apply/function node.
 *   - [Tracker] the tracker deals with the most common operations (inlining
 *     an apply node, declaring a new function...) while traversing terms.
