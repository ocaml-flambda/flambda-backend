module type Iterator = sig
  (** This module is really an interface for the trie iterators from "Leapfrog
      Triejoin: A Simple, Worst-Case Optimal Join Algorithm" by Todd L.
      Veldhuizen (1)), but because we want {e typed} iterators, we cannot
      implement the [open] and [up] methods from the paper directly.

      Instead, we build one iterator per level of the trie, and use hidden
      references (aka type wormholes) to communicate between the different
      levels of the iterator.

      The [up] function is no longer needed: the iterators at previous depths
      can directly be reused.

      The [open] function is split into two parts, [accept] and [init], which
      interact as follows.

      - [accept] is called on the iterator at depth [d]. This prepares the
        iterator at depth [d + 1] for iteration on the trie currently pointed to
        by the iterator at depth [d].

      - [init] is called on the iterator at depth [d] to start a new
        iteration at depth [d]. Each call to [init] on the iterator at depth [d]
        will iterate on the same set of keys until [accept] is called again on
        the iterator at depth [d - 1].

      There are two special cases:

       - When [accept] on the iterator at depth [d] and [d] is the last depth,
         there is no iterator at depth [d + 1]. Instead, the value associated
         with the current tuple is stored in another hidden reference -- the way
         to access this hidden reference depends on the concrete implementation
         of the [Iterator] signature.

       - There is no iterator at depth [-1], and so there is no way from this
         signature to set a value to iterate on at depth [0]. This is again done
         through explicit setting of yet another hidden reference whose location
         depends on the concrete implementation of the [Iterator] signature.

      i.e. the least key [y] such that [y >= x], exhausting the iterator if no
      such key exists.

      [seek] does nothing if [x] is smaller than the current key. *)

      the iterator at the next depth for iteration.
