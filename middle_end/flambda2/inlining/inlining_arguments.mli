(** Set of all arguments related to inlining. This set is stored inside the term
    language and is used to access the set of parameters to use in the
    simplifier.

    This module also allows to [meet] two sets of arguments, that is given t1
    and t2 to return the set of arguments that will inline at most as much as
    either t1 and t2 would. *)
