        {b Warning}: Cursors are {b mutable} data structures that are temporarily
        bound to a database and modified internally by iteration functions such as
        [iter] or [fold]. Reusing a cursor while it is being iterated over is
        unspecified behavior.

        {b Binding order}

        The order in which variables are provided to [Cursor.create] and
        [Cursor.create_with_parameters] is called the {b binding order}. For
        parameterized queries, the parameters appear before the variables in the
        binding order.

        This order corresponds to the nesting order of the loop nest that will be
        used to evaluate the query, so it can have dramatic performance impact and
        need to be chosen carefully.

        In order for the engine to be able to evaluate the query, variables must
        appear in the same order in at least one of the atoms constituting the
        query; for instance, it is not possible to iterate over
        [[edge [x; y]]] in the [[y; x]] binding order: we are requesting that [y]
        be bound before [x], but in order to find the set of possible values for
        [y] from [edge] we need to first know the possible values for [x]. These
        cases will raise an error.

        It is, however, possible to iterate on the query
        [[edge [x; y]; edge [y; x]] using the [[y; x]] binding order: we
        can use the [edge [y; x]] instance to bind the variables for [y] and [x]
        in this order, then check if [(x, y)] is in the [edge] relation for
        each [(y, x)] pair that we find. In this case, the occurrences of [y] and
        [x] in [edge [y; x]] are said to be {b binding}, while their occurrences
        in [edge [x; y]] are {b non-binding}.

        More precisely, an occurrence of a variable [x] in a positive atom is
        binding if all the previous arguments of the atom appear before [x] in the
        binding order; all other occurrences are non-binding. In order to
        evaluate a query, we require that all variables have at least one binding
        occurrence in the query.

        Occurrences from negated atoms (from [not]) are never binding.

            ['p Constant.hlist] that is provided when evaluating the cursor. *)

    (** [Cursor.create vars f] creates a low-level [Cursor.t] from a high-level
        query, expressed as a conjunction of atoms.

        {b Warning}: The order of the variables in [vars] is crucial as it
        dictates the iteration order of the loop nest that will be used to
        evaluate the query. See the documentation of the {!Cursor} module.

        {b Note}: If you need to perform queries that depend on the value of a
        variable outside the database, consider using parameterized cursors (see
        {!Cursor.create_with_parameters}). Reusing a parameterized cursor is more
        efficient than creating new cursors for each value of the parameters.

        {b Example}

        The following code creates cursors to iterate on the marked nodes
        ([marked_cursor]), and on all the edge pairs in the graphs
        ([edge_cursor]), respectively.

        {[
        let marked_cursor =
          Cursor.create ["X"] (fun [x] -> [marked [x]])

        let edge_cursor =
          Cursor.create ["src"; "dst"] (fun [src; dst] -> [edge [src; dst]])
        ]}
    *)
    val create : 'v String.hlist -> ('v Term.hlist -> hypothesis list) -> 'v t

    (** Create a parameterized cursor.

        This is a more general version of [Cursor.create] that also takes an
        additional list of parameters. The

        {b Example}

        The following code creates two parameterized cursors for iterating over
        the successors or predecessors of a parametric node, which will be
        provided when evaluating the query.

        Notice that in the [successor_cursor], the parameters appears {e before}
        the variable in the [edge] relation, while in the [predecessor_cursor], it
        appears {e after} the variable.

        This means that the [successor_cursor] can be iterated efficiently,
        because it follows the structure of the relation: internally, the [edge]
        relation is represented as a map from nodes to their successors, and so
        evaluating the [successor_cursor] will result in a simple map lookup.

        On the other hand, evaluating [predecessor_cursor] requires iterating over
        all the (non-terminal) nodes to check whether it contains [p] in its
        successor map.

        {[
