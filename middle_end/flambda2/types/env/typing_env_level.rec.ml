                 since the join of anything with [Unknown] is [Unknown], we
                 can return it directly.

                 - [name] is defined neither in [env_at_fork] nor in
                 [env_at_use]. In this case, the type for [name] is considered
                 [Bottom] in this branch, so we can return [joined_ty] directly.
