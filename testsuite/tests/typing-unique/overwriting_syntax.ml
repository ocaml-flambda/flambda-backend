(* CR uniqueness: It would be nice to also support the following syntactic forms:
     overwrite_ e with (~x:5, ..)
     overwrite_ e with { x = 4; _ }

   This would require us to allow general patterns as the top-level second argument to
   overwrite_ with. However, all overwritten fields should continue to be expressions.
