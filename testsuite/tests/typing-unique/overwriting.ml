(* Overwriting with mutation *)

(* Currently all tests in this section fail because mutable record fields
   are always aliased. But in the future, this will change!
   When mutable record fields can be unique, we have to ensure that users
   cannot change the tag using mutation before overwriting a cell with the
   knowledge of the old tag. We took that into account when designing this
   feature and all tests here should work correctly in that case.
   You can find the expected test outputs at PR3157. *)
