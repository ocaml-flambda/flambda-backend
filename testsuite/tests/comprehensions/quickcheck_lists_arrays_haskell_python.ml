   for Haskell, Python, and OCaml, and we can't count on the first two existing.

  (* We need to read every comprehension's output in a character-wise identical
     way.  We settle on Python's list syntax: square brackets (no pipes),
     comma-separated, with spaces after all the commas.  This choice is because
     (1) it's easier to replace all of OCaml's semicolons with commas than it it
     is to replace *some* of Haskell/Python's commas with semicolons; and (2) it
     looks nicer to have spaces after commas (like Python, as well as OCaml)
     than to not do so (like Haskell).  *)

  (* This custom printer is necessary because long lists cause the default
     printer to stack overflow.  Since we're writing our own, we use commas as a
     separator here, a la Python, rather than relying on the substitution later.
     (We do still have to substitute later, though, for arrays.) *)
