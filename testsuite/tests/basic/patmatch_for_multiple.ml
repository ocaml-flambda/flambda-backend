(* TEST
 flags = "-drawlambda -dlambda";

*)

(* Note: the tests below contain *both* the -drawlambda and
   the -dlambda intermediate representations:
   -drawlambda is the Lambda code generated directly by the
     pattern-matching compiler; it contain "alias" bindings or static
     exits that are unused, and will be removed by simplification, or
     that are used only once, and will be inlined by simplification.
   -dlambda is the Lambda code resulting from simplification.

  The -drawlambda output more closely matches what the
  pattern-compiler produces, and the -dlambda output more closely
  matches the final generated code.

  In this test we decided to show both to notice that some allocations
  are "optimized away" during simplification (see "here flattening is
  an optimization" below).

   The test cases below compare the compiler output on alias patterns
   that are outside an or-pattern (handled during half-simplification,

   We used to have a Cannot_flatten exception that would result in fairly
   different code generated in both cases, but now the compilation strategy
   is fairly similar.
