(** An integer that has the same width as the current DWARF format.

    Such integers (DWARF-4 specification section 7.4) are required to describe
    offsets within DWARF sections; they may be wider than the machine's native
    integers.

    All of the [size] functions for measuring the size of encoded DWARF
    constructs in this library return values of type [t], even if the encoding
    of such sizes may sometimes be done via a variable-length encoding. The
    reason that it is correct to use values of type [t] is because the width of
    the integers giving the size of any such constructs cannot exceed the width
    of the DWARF format. If they were to exceed such width then it would not be
    possible to encode every offset into the section containing such constructs
    using a DWARF-width integer, as mandated by the standard.

    Note that [Dwarf_format.set] must be called before using this module,
    otherwise exceptions may be raised. *)
