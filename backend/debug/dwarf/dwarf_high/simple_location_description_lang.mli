(** Higher-level representation of simple location descriptions than that
    provided by the DWARF standard. This representation is compiled down to
    [Simple_location_description.t] values.

    Functions in this interface are used to build descriptions that enable the
    debugger to know what value a particular variable has at runtime. These
    descriptions are categorised according to their surrounding context:

    - [Lvalue] descriptions are used when the context needs to know the _place_
    where a particular variable is stored. Typically such a description is some
    address in the target's memory or the name of some register in the target's
    CPU.

    - [Rvalue] descriptions are used when the context requires the _value_ of a
    particular variable rather than a description of the place where it lives.
    This is usually the case when the description is being used as some
    sub-expression of a larger DWARF expression.

    Sometimes the context requires that the address of a value has to be given,
    but such address cannot be computed, for example because the value has been
    entirely optimised out. However we may well know what the value itself is
    (or was). In these cases we use [Lvalue_without_address] semantics
    (corresponding to DWARF "implicit location descriptions"). These enable
    rvalues to be converted into descriptions that may be used in lvalue
    context; and to describe pointers that have been entirely optimised out.

    The descriptions of the functions are written in terms of some fictional
    value V and time T. The time is when the simple location description is
    being evaluated in the debugger to inspect V. *)
