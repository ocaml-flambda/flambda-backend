val check_cfg_with_layout :
  Mach.fundecl -> Cfg_with_layout.t -> Cfg_with_layout.t -> unit
(* [check_cfg_with_layout f expected result] checks whether [expected] and
 * [result] are equivalent, failing (through [Misc.fatal_errorf]) if they
 *  are not.
 *
 *  The passed CFGs are deemed equivalent iff:
 *  - the graphs are isomorphic;
 *  - the layouts are equal, up to the function mapping the vertices in the
 *    isomorphism above;
 *  and blocks are deemed equivalent iff:
 *  - they hold equivalent instruction lists;
 *  - they end with equivalent terminators;
 *  - they have the same value for their `trap_depth`, `can_raise`, `dead`,
 *    and `is_trap_handler` fields;
 *  - their successor and predecessor sets are equivalent up to the function
 *    mapping the vertices in the isomorphism above.
 *  (Instruction identifiers are ignored when comparing both mere instructions,
 *  and terminators.)
 *
 *  Caveat: the check currently ignores the live sets and debug information
 *  on all terminators, and the input registers on `Always _` terminators. *)
