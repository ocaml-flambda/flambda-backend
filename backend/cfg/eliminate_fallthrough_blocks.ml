  (* Find and disconnect fallthrough blocks (i.e., blocks with empty body and a
     single successor) by rerouting their predecessors to point directly to
     their successors. It can create a new fallthrough block, for example: if we
     have edges { A -> B, B -> C , A -> C }, with A empty, and B being the only
     fallthrough block. If we eliminate B, then A becomes fallthrough. As such
     we iterate until fixpoint.

     Disconnected fallthrough nodes can be eliminate by dead block elimination
     pass.

     Termination is guaranteed because every step eliminates a node. The order
     matters for performance but not for the final result. *)
