(** A "sub" CFG is the counterpart of an instruction list in the original Mach
    selection pass.

    It is essentially a collection of blocks (stored as a layout, i.e. as a
    list), with two designated blocks:

    - an entry block;

    - an exit block.

    The exit block is where more instructions are being added, which means that
    the terminator of an in-construction "sub" CFG is `Never`, and will be
    changed only when no additional instructions will be inserted to the
    block. *)
