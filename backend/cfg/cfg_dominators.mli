val compute_immediate_dominators : Cfg.t -> dominators -> immediate_dominators
(* [compute_immediate_dominators cfg doms] returns a map from labels to their
   immediate dominator, using the following definition: "the immediate dominator
   of a node n is the unique node that strictly dominates n but does not
   strictly dominate any other node that strictly dominates n". By definition,
   the returned map has a binding for each node of [cfg], except the entry
   point, assuming that all nodes are reachable from entry. *)

(* [compute_dominance_frontiers cfg doms idoms] returns a map from labels to
   their frontiers as sets of labels. The definition we use is the following:
   "the dominance frontier of a node n is the set of all nodes m such that n
   dominates a predecessor of m, but does not strictly dominate m itself". *)
