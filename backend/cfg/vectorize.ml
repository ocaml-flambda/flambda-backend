(* CR-someday gyorsh: Dependencies computed below can be used for other

(**
   Construct an overapproximation of transitive dependencies between instructions, and
   use this information to identify instructions that can run in parallel and can be
   reordered.

   Approach:
   =========

   Record a direct dependency from instruction [i] to [j] if one of the following
   conditions holds:

   (a) Dependency via registers: [i] may read from a register [r] a value that was
   previously written to [r] by instruction [j].

   (b) Dependency via memory: [i] may read to a memory location that [j] may
   write to (RAW memory dependency).

   (c) Ordering via memory: [i] and [j] may access the same memory location,
   and one of the accesses is a "write" (this covers WAR and WAW dependencies,
   as well as dependencies of reads and writes on allocation).

   Vectorizable computation
   ========================
   TODO add citation

   The method for constructing vectorizable computations.
   - Group: a sequence of scalar instructions that are independent of each other, and have
   an equivalent vector instruction. Most groups correspond to one vector instruction,
   but sometimes a sequence of vector instructions is needed, for example scalar addition
   of a register and a constant.
   - Current heuristic for identifying vectorizable instructions requires that memory
   accesses of scalar instructions are adjacent and have the same base address and
   addressing mode.
   - Seed: a group of store instructions.
   - Vectorizable computation is set of groups of scalar instructions that can be replaced
   with equivalent vector instructions.
   - Find vectorizable computations: starting from a seed group, traverse the dependencies
   backwards to construct groups for each of the arguments. Stop at load instructions (and
   constant arguments).
   - Use (a) during the backward traversal to find scalar instruction need to form
   a group.
   - Use both (a) and (b) dependencies to determine whether scalar instructions can run in
   parallel and therefore can form a group.
   - Use (c) to determine the placement of vector instructions for each group in the
   block, relative to other instructions. Order constraints detemine when scalar
   instructions can be executed.
   - Key: conservatively choose the position to the last scalar instruction of the group
   to place the vector instructions for the group.
   - Conservatively require that all ordering constraints from a scalar instruction in a
   vectorizable computation is to instructions that appear earlier in the block,
   before the first scalar instruction of the computation.
   - Conservatively require that nothing depends (via a,b,c)
   on scalar instructions in the computation.

   Heuristics
   ==========
   Identify disjoint memory accesses to improve precision of memory dependency and
   ordering overapproximation. Use the following observations:

   (1) A freshly-allocated memory block is disjoint from all previously-allocated blocks.

   A crude version of points-to analysis with allocation site abstraction is sufficient to
   track this information.

   (2) Different offsets from the same base address.

   If both memory accesses use the same base address, and offsets from the base address
   can statically be shown to refer to non-overlapping address intervals.

   Two memory accesses have the same base address if they use the same register for the
   base address, and the register contains the same value, i.e., there are no writes to
   this register between the two memory accesses.

   (3) Two valid ocaml blocks are disjoint, except for closure blocks.

   A register points to a valid ocaml block iff [Reg.typ] is [Val].

   For two different registers that point to valid ocaml blocks, one of the following
   conditions holds:
    - the registers point to the same block, or
    - the registers point to disjoint blocks, or
    - the registers point to closure blocks.

   To rule out closure blocks, we use the following observation.

   Closures cannot be modified after initialization. All stores to closure blocks emitted
   by the ocaml compiler are initializing stores.  Therefore, if a register that points to
   a valid ocaml block is used in an address computation of a non-initializing store, then
   the block it points to is not a closure block.

   The type system guarantees that there is no pointer arithmetic between valid ocaml
   blocks: an address computed as an offset from a register that points to a valid ocaml
   block cannot point to a different valid ocaml block, except for closure blocks.

   If two registers (a) point to valid ocaml blocks, (b) one of the blocks is not a
   closure block, and (c) a memory access uses one of the registers as base address,
   then a memory access that uses the other base address is disjoint if the accesses
   refer to non-overlapping address intervals (similarly to (2)).

   Overview of the implementation
   ==============================

   - Partition: represents a set of memory blocks that are disjoint from memory blocks
   represented by other partitions. A memory block need not be on the ocaml heap.
   - Points-to graph: for each partition, track the set of partitions it may point to.
   - Initial partition [unknown] represents all other memory blocks, previously allocated on
   the ocaml heap or elsewhere, and it may point to itself.
   - Fresh allocations: Track that a partition represents exactly one ocaml block. Such a
   partion is a result of an allocation instruction, and known to be disjoint from all
   other partitions, and initially has no valid pointers to or from other partitions.
   - Aliases: For each register, track the set of partitions it may point to.
   - Memory accesses: For each instruction, identify the set of partitions that the
   instruction may access for read or write.
   - For each partition, track the set of instructions that may read from it or write
   to it.
   - For each instruction [i] that may write to partition [p], and each instruction [j] that
   appears before [i] in the basic block and may access the same partition [p] for read
   or write, if heuristic conditions (2) and (3) above do not hold, then add a direct
   dependency from [i] to [j]. Note that it will add dependency from Load to Store.

   Computing aliases and points-to graph
   =====================================

   - Initially, all registers may point to [unknown] partition.
   - If a register is clobbered, its partition is reset to empty, representing the fact
   that it does not contain a valid pointer and it is illegal for the program to access
   memory that this register may point to.
   - If a register is assigned a static constant, its partition is reset to [unknown],
   representing the fact that a constant may point to statically allocated memory, but it
   is illegal to use it to access any partitions freshly allocated on the OCaml heap.
   - If a register is used as RHS of a store (i.e., the value to store), add edges
   between the corresponding partitions: the partitions of the LHS of the store (i.e., the
   address arguments of the store) may point to the partitions of RHS.
   - If register [r] is used as a LHS of a load (i.e., result of the load), then after the
   load [r] may point to partition [p'] if [p] is an RHS of this load (i.e., address
   arguments of the load) may point to, and [p] may point to [p'].
   - For all other assignments, propagate points-to information from arguments to results.
   - Edges between partitions can be added but not removed (i.e., no strong update
   of the points-to graph). Strong updates of aliases within a basic block are safe.

   Complexity
   ========
   - The number of partitions is n+1 where n is the number of allocation instruction in
   the block.
   - Tracking of memory accesses of each partition is quadratic in [n] in the worst case,
   but in practice should be much smaller.
   - Single pass on the block's body to construct memory dependencies.
