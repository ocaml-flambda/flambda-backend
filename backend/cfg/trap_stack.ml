  (* Empty is not shared, for safety, at the cost of additional allocations. The
     current implementation does not change a reference whose contents is
     `Empty`. However, if someone adds an operation that does not respect this
     property, it might induce hard-to-track bugs. Currently, the only client of
     this code is linear_to_cfg, which invokes [empty ()] only once per cfg, so
     the additonal allocation is negligible compared to everything else
     constructed in the same pass. Another client may choose to reusing the
     reference, and rely on the specifics of the current implementation,
     breaking abstraction. *)
