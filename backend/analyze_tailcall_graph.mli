(** Tailcall analysis: constructs a call graph whose vertices are functions and whose
    edges are calls in syntactic tail position. Edges are labeled with whether they are
    explicitly TCO'd ([@tail] or [@tail hint]), implicitly TCO'd, or implicitly not TCO'd.
    (Whether a function is implicitly TCO'd or not depends on the heuristic we are
    developing as part of the less-tco project.) *)
