(** Tailcall analysis: constructs a call graph whose vertices are functions and whose
    edges are calls in syntactic tail position. Edges are labeled with whether they are
    explicitly TCO'd ([@tail] or [@tail hint]), implicitly TCO'd, or implicitly not TCO'd.
    (Whether a function is implicitly TCO'd or not depends on the heuristic we are
    developing as part of the less-tco project.) *)

(* When we inline, we don't merge the position_and_tail_attribute. This means
   that we might report false positives when warning about inferred tails in
   TCO'd cycles: if A calls B in Tail_position Default_tail, and A is inlined
   into C, the calls to B keep their Tail_position Default_tail. Then, when we
   see these calls in the backend, they are not tail calls (because they cannot
   actually be optimized to tail calls because they are not in tail position),
   and we incorrectly deduce that C has inferred nontail calls. Furthermore, if
   these (deduced wrong) nontail calls participate in a TCO'd cycle, we will
   raise supurious inferred-nontail-in-tcod-cycle warnings.

   In the future should properly merge the attributes, but a workaround we do
   here is to traverse the CMM to replace position_and_tail_attributes in
   non-tail CMM position with an Inlined_into_not_tail_position attribute. *)
