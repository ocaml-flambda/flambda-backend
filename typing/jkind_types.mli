(** You should use the types defined in [Jkind] (which redefines the
   types in this file) rather than using this file directly, unless you
   are in [Types] or [Primitive]. *)

(* This module defines types used in the module Jkind. This is to avoid a mutual
   dependencies between jkind.ml(i) and types.ml(i) and bewteen jkind.ml(i) and
   primitive.ml(i). Polymorphic versions of types are defined here, with type
   parameters that are meant to be filled by types defined in
   types.ml(i). jkind.ml(i) redefines the types from this file types.ml with the
   type variables instantiated. types.ml also redefines the types from this file
   with the type variables instantiated, but only for internal
   use. primitive.ml(i) uses the type [Jkind.Const.t], and types.ml(i) depends
   on primitive.ml(i), so [Jkind.Const.t] is defined here and primitive.ml(i)
   also uses this module.

   Dependency chain without Jkind_types:
         _____________________
         |         |         |
         |         |         V
   Primitive <-- Types <-- Jkind

   Dependency chain with Jkind_types:
        ______________________________________
        |                          |         |
        V                          |         |
   Jkind_types <-- Primitive <-- Types <-- Jkind
