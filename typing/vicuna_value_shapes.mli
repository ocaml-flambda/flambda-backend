(** This file defines a representation of the runtime shapes of OCaml values.
    These shapes are different from (and unrelated to) the shapes defined in
    [typing/shape.mli]. *)

type value_shape =
  | Value  (** anything of C type [value] *)
  | Imm  (** immediate, tagged with a one at the end *)
  | Nativeint
      (** block of a native word integer, e.g., 64-bit integer on amd64
          target *)
  | Double  (** block of a native double *)
  | Int64  (** block of a 64-bit integer *)
  | Int32  (** block of a 32-bit integer *)
  | String
      (** block of a char pointer with a size, representing both Bytes.t and
          String.t *)
  | FloatArray  (** block containing native doubles *)
  | Block of (int * value_shape list) option
      (** Block whose tag is below no-scan tag (i.e., a normal ocaml block
      value). If the argment is [None], then the block could have any tag and
      any elements. If the argument is [Some (t, shs)], then [t] is the tag of
      the block and [shs] contains the shapes of its fields. In the case of
      [Some (t, shs)], the number of fields is known statically (i.e., the
      length of the list [shs]).

      To represent arrays (which are blocks with tag 0 at run time, but whose
      size is not statically known), there is a separate construtor, [Array sh],
      which keeps track of the shapes of the elements. *)

  | Or of value_shape * value_shape
