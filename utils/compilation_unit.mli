(* Handling of the names of compilation units, including associated "-for-pack"
   prefixes and instance arguments.

   By "compilation unit" we mean the code and data associated with the
   compilation of a single .ml source file: that is to say, file-level entities
   having OCaml semantics. The notion neither includes the special "startup"
   files nor external libraries. If the source file was compiled with
   "-parameter", then in addition to the compilation unit for the .ml file
   itself (the _base_), instantiation will produce further compilation units
   (the _instances_; see [create_instance]). *)

  (** [dummy] is a placeholder for units that does not have a valid name, as
      in the, or during initialisation of the compiler.  It is not a valid
      identifier and thus cannot be generated through [of_string]. *)

val create_instance : t -> argument list -> t

(** Create the compilation unit named by the given [Global_module.Name.t]. Only
    meaningful if the global name is a _complete instantiation_, which is to say
    either (a) the named module has no parameters, or (b) there is an argument
    for each parameter and each argument is itself a complete instantiation.
    This ensures the name determines a compile-time constant, and then the [t]
    returned here is the module corresponding to that constant. *)
val of_global_name : Global_module.Name.t -> t

(** Convert the compilation unit to a [Global_module.Name.t], if possible (which
    is to say, if its prefix is empty). *)

(** Like [to_global_name] but succeed even when there is a pack prefix,

val to_global_name_without_prefix : t -> Global_module.Name.t

(** Create a compilation unit from the given [name]. No prefix is allowed;
    throws a fatal error if there is a "." in the name. (As a special case,
    a "." is allowed as the first character, to handle compilation units
    which take their names from hidden files.) *)
val of_string : string -> t

(** Create a global [Ident.t] representing this compilation unit. Only intended
    for use in bytecode; most uses of [Ident.t]s that are known to be global
    should simply use [t] instead. *)
val to_global_ident_for_bytecode : t -> Ident.t

(** Find whether one compilation unit has another as a child. That is, whether
    the other unit has this one as its path prefix. *)
val is_parent : t -> child:t -> bool

(** Find whether one compilation unit can access another directly, without going
    through a pack. Equivalently, find whether one unit's .cmx file is visible
    while compiling another. Access to a packed unit is allowed only "from
    inside the pack," which is to say, a unit can only access its own members
    and those of its ancestors, though not the ancestors themselves. Thought of
    as a node in a tree, this means a module can access its own children, its
    own siblings, and its ancestors' siblings.

    In terms of paths, in order for [X] to access [Y],

    (1) [Y]'s prefix must be equal to or a prefix of [X]'s full path, and
    (2) [Y] itself must not be (strictly) a prefix of [X] (though [X] and [Y] may
        be equal).

    For example:

    * [A.B.C] _can_ access [A.Q] because [A.Q] is a member of [A] and [A] is
      an ancestor of [A.B.C]. In other words, [A.Q]'s prefix is [A] and [A] is a
      prefix of [A.B.C].
    * [A.Q] _cannot_ access [A.B.C] because [A.B] is not a prefix of [A.Q].
    * [A.Q] _can_ however access [A.B], because [A] _is_ a prefix of [A.Q].
    * [A.Q] _can_ also access its own member, [A.Q.R], because [A.Q.R]'s prefix
      is exactly [A.Q].
    * [A.Q] _cannot_ access [A.Q.R.S], because [A.Q.R] is not a prefix of [A.Q].
    * [A.Q] _can_ access [F], since [F]'s prefix is the empty path, which is
      trivially a prefix of [A.Q].
    * [A.Q] _cannot_ access [F.G] (by criterion 1) or [A] (by criterion 2). *)
val can_access_by_name : t -> accessed_by:t -> bool

(** A clearer name for [can_access_by_name] when the .cmx file is what's of
    interest. *)
val can_access_cmx_file : t -> accessed_by:t -> bool

(*_ CR-someday lmaurer: Arguably [which_cmx_file] should return a different
  type, since "compilation unit for which we can load the .cmx" is an important
  constraint. *)

(** Determine which .cmx file to load for a given compilation unit.
    This is tricky in the case of packs.  It can be done by lining up the
    desired compilation unit's full path (i.e. pack prefix then unit name)
    against the accessing unit's full path and observing when/if they
    diverge.

    This is only used for native code compilation. *)

    instance arguments, they're encoded in a Bash-friendly but otherwise
    unspecified manner. *)
val base_filename : t -> Misc.filepath

(** Return a representation of the name as its prefix, its name, and its
    arguments with nesting levels attached. Good for implementing horrible name
    mangling and little else. So:

      * [Foo] ==> [[], "Foo", []]
      * [Foo[X:Bar]] ==> [[], "Foo", [(0, "X", "Bar")]]
      * [Foo[X:Bar][Y:Baz]] ==> [[], "Foo", [(0, "X", "Bar"); (0, "Y", "Baz")]]
      * [Foo[X:Bar[Y:Baz]]] ==> [[], "Foo", [(0, "X", "Bar"); (1, "Y", "Baz")]]

    I believe it's possible to parse this form back to the usual nested form,
    which one should only want to do in order to prove the encoding is
    unambiguous.
