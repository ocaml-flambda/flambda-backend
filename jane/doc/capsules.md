# Capsules

A _capsule_ is a collection of mutable state accessible via a particular API that prohibits data races.

_This page introduces the "expert" capsule API, which may be found in `Portable.Capsule.Expert`.
A more ergonomic but slightly less expressive API will be available in `Portable.Capsule`._

## Data

Data that lives in a capsule is represented by the type `('a, 'k) Capsule.Data.t`.
For example, to create a fresh `int ref` that lives in a capsule:

```ocaml
let capsule_ref = Capsule.Data.create (fun () -> ref 0)
```

The encapsulated reference has type `(int ref, 'k) Capsule.Data.t`, which we may interpret as a pointer to an `int ref` that lives in capsule `'k`.

The type parameter `'k` is known as a *capsule brand*, and uniquely identifies a capsule at compile time.
Given two capsule pointers with the same `'k`, we know they point into the same capsule, so they may be merged:

```ocaml
val both : ('a, 'k) t -> ('b, 'k) t -> ('a * 'b, 'k) t @@ portable
```

However, if you create capsule data at top level, you'll see a slightly different type:

```ocaml
$ let capsule_ref = Capsule.Data.create (fun () -> ref 0);;

> val capsule_ref : (int ref, '_weak1) Capsule.Data.t = <abstr>
```

Here, the brand is _weakly polymorphic_.
Later on, the compiler will infer that the brand is that of a particular capsule `'k`&mdash;it just doesn't know which one yet.

Encapsulated data crosses portability and contention.
That means we can share a `Capsule.Data.t` across any number of `portable` functions without it becoming `contended`.
For example, we could use `capsule_ref` at `uncontended` in both branches of a fork/join expression.

```ocaml
let fork_join parallel =
  let capsule_ref = Capsule.Data.create (fun () -> ref 0) in
  Parallel.fork_join2 parallel
    (fun _ -> (capsule_ref : _ @ uncontended))
    (fun _ -> (capsule_ref : _ @ uncontended))
;;
```

To prevent races, the capsule API assures that only one domain at a time can dereference a capsule pointer.
There are three mechanisms for doing so, each of which builds on the former.

## Accesses

The first mechanism is _access_.
A value of type `'k Capsule.Access.t` indicates that we are currently executing within the capsule `'k`.
When `'k` is the current capsule, we know that no other domains can access `'k`, so it is safe to dereference pointers into `'k`.

```ocaml
let increment ~(access : 'k Capsule.Access.t) capsule_ref =
  let ref = Capsule.Data.unwrap ~access capsule_ref in
  ref := !ref + 1
;;
```

Accesses **do not** cross contention, and `unwrap` requires an `uncontended` access.
Hence, accesses cannot be freely shared between `portable` functions&mdash;semantically, calling a `portable` function changes the current capsule, so we can no longer examine data in `'k`.
This property prohibits data races, as we can see with fork/join:

```ocaml
let parallel_increment parallel ~(access : 'k Capsule.Access.t) =
  let capsule_ref = Capsule.Data.create (fun () -> ref 0) in
  Parallel.fork_join2 parallel
    (fun _ -> increment ~access capsule_ref)
(*                       ^^^^^^                            *)
(* This value is contended but expected to be uncontended. *)
    (fun _ -> increment ~access capsule_ref)
;;
```

So, how do we obtain access to a capsule?
The simplest way is to use the top-level access associated with the initial domain:

```ocaml
let (initial : Capsule.initial Capsule.Access.t) = Capsule.initial
```

Accesses don't cross contention, so only `nonportable` functions can capture an `uncontended` reference to `initial`.
Then, since top-level `nonportable` functions always execute on the initial domain, they may manipulate data in the initial capsule.

```ocaml
let increment_initial () =
  let initial_ref = Capsule.Data.create (fun () -> ref 0) in
  increment initial_ref ~access:Capsule.Access.initial
;;
```

Although `portable` functions don't execute in the initial capsule, they always execute in _some_ capsule.
Hence, we can always ask for access to the current capsule:

```ocaml
let increment_current () =
  let (P access) = Capsule.current () in
  let current_ref = Data.create (fun () -> ref 0) in
  increment current_ref ~access
;;
```

But we don't know whether the current capsule has the same brand as any preexisting capsule.
Therefore, `Capsule.current` returns a _packed_ access, and unpacking the result generates a fresh `'k` that's distinct from the brand of all other capsules.

Unfortunately, that means we can never access data from capsules other than the current one.

```ocaml
let increment_other (other_ref : (int ref, 'k) Capsule.Data.t) =
  let (P access) = Capsule.current () in
  increment other_ref ~access
(*                     ^^^^^^                                   *)
(* This expression has type (int ref, 'k) Capsule.Data.t but an *)
(* expression was expected of type (int ref, $k) Capsule.Data.t *)
```

_Note the capsule brand is printed as `$k`, indicating it was generated by locally unpacking `access`._

Providing access to a particular capsule is the purpose of the second mechanism: _passwords_.

## Passwords

A value of type `'k Capsule.Password.t` represents permission to make `'k` the current capsule.
Given a password, we can request an access:

```ocaml
let increment ~(password : 'k Capsule.Password.t @ local) capsule_ref =
  Capsule.access ~password (fun access ->
    let ref = Capsule.Data.unwrap ~access capsule_ref in
    ref := !ref + 1)
  [@nontail]
;;
```

Passwords **do** cross contention, so they can be freely shared between `portable` functions.
Naively, that would introduce races, but passwords are also always [`local`](https://oxcaml.org/documentation/stack-allocation/intro/).
That means we still can't transfer a password across domains: fork/join requires global functions, which cannot capture a `local` password.

<!-- CR-soon mslater: this is actually enforced by the yielding axis; at some
     point we will allow local fork/join and this will be wrong. -->

```ocaml
let parallel_increment parallel ~(password : 'k Capsule.Password.t @ local) =
  let capsule_ref = Capsule.Data.create (fun () -> ref 0) in
  Parallel.fork_join2 parallel
    (fun _ -> increment ~password capsule_ref)
(*                       ^^^^^^^^                                                      *)
(* The value password is local, so cannot be used inside a function that might escape. *)
    (fun _ -> increment ~password capsule_ref)
  [@nontail]
;;
```

Semantically, the primary use of passwords is requesting access, since that's what lets you unwrap capsule data.
However, `Capsule.Data` also provides a variety of convenience functions for operating on capsule data _in situ_.
These functions require passwords, since they do not assume that the current capsule is the correct one.

```ocaml
val map
  :  password:'k Capsule.Password.t @ local
  -> f:('a -> 'b) @ local once portable
  -> ('a, 'k) Capsule.Data.t
  -> ('b, 'k) Capsule.Data.t
```

For example, `Capsule.Data.map` runs the function `f` in the capsule `'k`, providing access to the encapsulated `'a` and returning an encapsulated `'b`.
Passwords can also provide more flexibility than accesses, since they may be captured by `local portable` functions.
We'll see an example of when this can be useful later on.

However, we still haven't explained how to get a password!
That brings us to the third mechanism: _keys_.

## Keys

A value of type `'k Capsule.Key.t` is, in some sense, the capsule `'k` itself.
Creating a key is equivalent to creating a capsule:

```ocaml
let (P (key : _ Capsule.Key.t)) = Capsule.create ()
```

Like we saw with `Capsule.current`, creation returns a packed key, so unpacking it gives us a `'k Capsule.Key.t` for a brand-new capsule `'k`.
We can then use the key to get a password:

```ocaml
let increment_fresh () =
  let (P key) = Capsule.create () in
  let fresh_ref = Capsule.Data.create (fun () -> ref 0) in
  Capsule.Key.with_password key ~f:(fun password ->
    increment ~password fresh_ref)
;;
```

Like passwords, keys cross contention.
However, keys need not be `local`&mdash;to prohibit races, keys rely on _uniqueness_.

Uniqueness is a mode axis that describes whether there exist multiple references to a value.
When a value has the `unique` mode, we know it is the only reference to its contents.
The default uniqueness mode is `aliased`, which means other references may exist.

`Capsule.Key.with_password` requires a unique key: if we can show that there are no other references to `key`, we gain permission to access the associated capsule.
Therefore, as with the other two mechanisms, we still can't share a key across fork/join:

```ocaml
let parallel_keys parallel =
  let (P key) = Capsule.create () in
  Parallel.fork_join2 parallel
    (fun _ ->
      Capsule.Key.with_password key ~f:(fun _ -> ()) |> ignore)
    (fun _ ->
      Capsule.Key.with_password key ~f:(fun _ -> ()) |> ignore)
(*                              ^^^                                 *)
(* This value is used here, but it is already being used as unique. *)
;;
```

However, unlike a password or an access, a key may be _moved_ into one of the branches:

```ocaml
let parallel_key parallel =
  let (P key) = Capsule.create () in
  let capsule_ref = Capsule.Data.create (fun () -> ref 0) in
  Parallel.fork_join2 parallel
    (fun _ ->
      Capsule.Key.with_password key ~f:(fun password -> increment ~password capsule_ref)
      |> ignore)
    (fun _ -> ())
;;
```

Here, the first task captures `key` uniquely, so we know the parent domain has renounced access to the associated capsule.
It's therefore perfectly safe to run the first task on another domain.

Furthermore, _destroying_ a key allows us to merge the associated capsule into the current capsule.
Concretely, passing a `'k` key to `Key.destroy` consumes it, so we know it can never be used again.
We get back a `'k` access, indicating that `'k` is part of the current capsule.

```ocaml
let merge_fresh () =
  let (P key) = Capsule.create () in
  let capsule_ref = Capsule.Data.create (fun () -> ref 0) in
  let access = Capsule.Key.destroy key in
  let ref = Capsule.Data.unwrap ~access capsule_ref in
  ref := !ref + 1
;;
```

These three abstractions&mdash;access, password, and key&mdash;provide three distinct approaches to arbitrating capsule access.
Because each type's safety properties rely on a different mode axis, they enable different parallel programming patterns.
In summary:

Type            | Represents                              | Provides                | Safety Axis
----------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------|------------
`'k Access.t`   | Proof that `'k` is the current capsule. | Access to data in `'k`. | Contention
`'k Password.t` | Permission to enter capsule `'k`.       | `'k Access.t`           | Locality
`'k Key.t`      | The capsule `'k` itself.                | `'k Password.t`         | Uniqueness

## Locks

At long last, we can get to the ultimate point of capsules: sharing mutable state across domains.

All abstractions covered so far rule out data races _statically_&mdash;one way or another, they require that state is never actually shared.
Fortunately, we now have all the tools needed to define _locks_: at runtime, a `'k Capsule.Mutex.t` will enforce that only one domain at a time can access `'k`.

To create a mutex for capsule `'k`, we consume its key:

```ocaml
let parallel_mutexes parallel =
  let (P key) = Capsule.create () in
  let mutex = Capsule.Mutex.create key in
  (* ... *)
;;
```

Intuitively, `mutex` now represents the capsule `'k`, since it contains the `'k` key.
We can think of a mutex as a _dynamically unique_ key: whenever we lock the mutex, we gain exclusive access to `'k`.
Therefore, locking a mutex produces a password.

```ocaml
let parallel_mutexes parallel =
  let (P key) = Capsule.create () in
  let mutex = Capsule.Mutex.create key in
  let capsule_ref = Capsule.Data.create (fun () -> ref 0) in
    Parallel.fork_join2 parallel
    (fun _ ->
      Capsule.Mutex.with_lock mutex ~f:(fun password -> increment ~password capsule_ref))
    (fun _ ->
      Capsule.Mutex.with_lock mutex ~f:(fun password -> increment ~password capsule_ref))
;;
```

As you might expect, mutexes cross contention and are neither `local` nor `unique`.
In fact, mutexes have no restrictions at all, so may be freely shared between `portable` functions, fork/join tasks, and domains.
