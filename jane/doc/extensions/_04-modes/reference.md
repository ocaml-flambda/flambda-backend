The goal of this document is to be a reasonably complete reference to the mode system in
OxCaml.

<!-- CR zqian: For a gentler introduction, see [the introduction](../intro). -->

The mode system in the compiler tracks various properties of values, so that certain
performance-enhancing operations can be performed safely. For example:
- Locality tracks escaping. See [the local allocations reference](../../stack/reference)
- Uniqueness and linearity tracks aliasing. See [the uniqueness reference](../../uniqueness/reference)
- Portability and contention tracks inter-thread sharing.
    <!-- CR zqian: reference for portability and contention -->

# Lazy
`lazy e` contains a thunk that evaluates `e`, as well as a mutable cell to store the
result of `e`. Upon construction, the mode of `lazy e` cannot be stronger than `e`. For
example, if `e` is `nonportable`, then `lazy e` cannot be `portable`. Upon destruction
(forcing a lazy value), the result cannot be stronger than the mode of lazy value. For
example, forcing a `nonportable` lazy value cannot give a `portable` result. Additionally,
forcing a lazy value involves accessing the mutable cell and thus requires the lazy value
to be `uncontended`.

Currently, the above rules don't apply to the locality axis, because both the result and
the lazy value are heap-allocated, so they are always `global`.

Additionally, upon construction, the comonadic fragment of `lazy e` cannot be stronger
than the thunk. The thunk is checked as `fun () -> e`, potentially closing over variables,
which weakens its comonadic fragment. This rule doesn't apply to several axes:
- The thunk is always heap-allocated so always `global`.
- Since the thunk is only evaluated if the lazy value is `uncontended`, one can construct
a lazy value at `portable` even if the thunk is `nonportable` (e.g., closing over
`uncontended` or `nonportable` values). For example, the following is allowed:
```ocaml
let r = ref 0 in
let l @ portable = lazy (r := 42) in
```
- Since the thunk runs at most once even if the lazy value is forced multiple times, one
can construct the lazy value at `many` even if the thunk is `once` (e.g., closing over
`unique` or `once` values). For example, the following is allowed:
```ocaml
let r = { x = 0 } in
let l @ many = lazy (overwrite_ r with { x = 42 })
```
