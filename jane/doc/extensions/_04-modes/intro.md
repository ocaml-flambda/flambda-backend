# Introduction to the Mode System

The locality mode used for [Stack allocation](../stack/intro) has been
extended to more axes, each tracking a property of values, in order to support
features such as [Parallelism](../parallelism/intro) and
[Uniqueness](../uniqueness/intro). This documentation gives a general
introduction to the mode system.

*This is a stub. Documentation will come soon.*
