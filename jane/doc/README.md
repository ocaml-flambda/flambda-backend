# Documentation of Jane Street OCaml extensions

This directory contains documentation of our extensions.

The `extensions/` subdirectory is the source code for the OxCaml website,
mirrored to the web on compiler release. Internal links there will not work on
Github. Adding new files in the existing directories should just work, but if
you change the structure it is also necessary to change the website's code,
which is kept in an internal Jane Street repository.

CR ccasinghino: Automate the necessary changes.
