(** Capsules are a mechanism for safely having [uncontended]
    access to mutable data from multiple domains. The interface
    in this module ensures that only one domain can have [uncontended]
    access to that data at a time.

    We consider every piece of mutable data in the program to live
    inside of some capsule. This might be an explicit capsule created
    by the user using this interface, or an implicit capsule created
    when a new domain is started. Whenever some thread is executing
    a function it has uncontended access to a single capsule and any
    new mutable data it creates is created within that capsule. We say
    that the function is "running within" the capsule.

    Capsules are only ever associated with threads from one domain at
    a time, which ensures there are no data races in the program. The
    implicit capsules created when a new domain is started are only ever
    associated with threads in that domain. Explicit capsules can change
    which domains have uncontended access to them using synchronization
    primitives. Currently each explicit capsule has an associated mutex
    that controls access to it. In the future there will also be other
    synchronization mechanisms available to control access to explicit capsules.

    Each explicit capsule is associated with a type "brand" -- written ['k]
    throughout this interface -- which allows us to statically reason about
    access to the capsule within the type system.  In the documentation of
    this interface we will often use ['k] to refer to the capsule associated
    with that brand. *)
